Why does Liam write down a number like \"8\" or \"11\" instead of just saying the apples verbally?  \n2. If Liam initially counts 8 apples, what does the number \"8\" tell us about the apples in the basket?  \n3. When Liam adds 3 apples and updates the number to \"11,\" what does this new number tell us about the basket's contents after the addition?\n\n**Think through:**\n- How does understanding what a number represents help Liam communicate how many apples are in the basket?\n- How does recognizing the symbol \"8\" or \"11\" relate to the actual quantity of apples?\n- What would happen if Liam knew the number but didn't understand what it represented? Would the number still tell him how many apples there are?",

Recognizing objects means being able to tell when something is a separate thing, not just part of a bigger group. Counting is the process of saying how many separate objects there are—like saying “one, two, three…”. To do this well, you need to match each object to a number, making sure you don’t count the same one twice. Think of it like lining up toy cars: recognizing each car is separate, and counting is just saying how many cars are in the line.\n\nDoes this make sense? Ready to continue?",

Imagine you have a basket of apples, and you count that there are 5 apples. The number 5 tells you the quantity of apples you have. So, quantity is simply how much or how many of something there are. Think of it like filling a jar with marbles—more marbles mean a bigger quantity, and fewer marbles mean a smaller quantity.\n\nDoes this make sense?",

Now apples are only 1 more than oranges instead of 3 more.\n\nRecognizing and counting helps determine quantities by identifying each object as separate and assigning numbers to them.

For example, the symbol \"3\" means three objects, like three apples. When you see a number symbol, you know exactly how many items it represents without counting each one again.

Recognizing the symbol \"4\" helps because the student can look at the symbol on the card and know it represents 4 objects without recounting.

The student may not have learned that \"2\" and \"5\" are different symbols representing different quantities.
