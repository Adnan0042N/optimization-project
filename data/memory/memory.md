### Understanding the concept of quantity
- Mastered: 2026-02-12 23:47
- Synthesis answer: Let me answer these questions:

1. How many more apples than oranges? Maria has 8 apples and 5 oranges, so there are 3 more apples (8 - 5 = 3).

2. If Maria adds 3 oranges, does the number equal the a
- Key insight: Recognizing the relationship between counting objects and understanding comparative quantities is fundamental to grasping basic mathematical concepts.


### Recognizing symbols used to represent numbers
- Mastered: 2026-02-12 23:49
- Synthesis answer: 1. The problem is the student counted correctly (4 blocks) but the card shows "3". The mismatch means either they miscounted or the card is wrong for that set. The student needs to recognize that the 
- Key insight: Recognizing symbols serves as a crucial shortcut that complements counting, but both are essential for accurate number matching.


### Understanding of what a number is
- Mastered: 2026-02-12 23:50
